\f0\fs24 \cf0 There are many ways to approach the workflow, but generally it is this approach: 1) create .txt caption files for all of the bespoke punks 2) train model on the bespoke punks and captions 3) upload real image/avatar, generate/quantize color palette and captions 4) feed this + pre-image to model 5) generate new bespoke punk\
\
I have ~200 bespoke punks with their before images and captions for training\'85 I have models on replicate, hugging face and now RunPod. I have also tried for months before Cursor/Claude code to use just Replit, Vercel, Lovable, etc\'85. \
\
Part of the challenge is: 1) generating more training images from the 200 I have already to make the model even more robust and accurate 2) getting the captions just right (not too long, not too short, just the right amount of detail) to train the model for robust image transformations w all traits 3) finding the right models and settings to actually train the models on my data. \
