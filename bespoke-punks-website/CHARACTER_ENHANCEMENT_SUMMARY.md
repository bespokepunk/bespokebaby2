## Character Analysis Method

Visual traits were determined by:

2. Analyzing 24x24 pixel art for:
   - Hair color and style
   - Accessories (glasses, hats, crowns, bandanas, jewelry)
   - Skin tone and features
   - Outfit colors and patterns
   - Overall vibe and expression
3. Integrating these specific details into existing prompt narratives

## Result

Each punk now has a personalized miniature world that feels like "their" space, featuring a tiny character figure that matches their exact appearance while maintaining the whimsical, handcrafted, Burton-meets-Laika aesthetic.

The worlds tell stories about each punk while preserving the mysterious, tactile, stop-motion quality that makes them feel alive when you're not looking.
