## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING ALL 194 PROMPTS

Each prompt must follow this structure:

1. **Match portrait background color exactly** - If portrait has lime green bg, world is lime green. If terracotta orange bg, world is terracotta orange.

2. **Use portrait color palette** - Include the 4-6 dominant colors from the portrait in the world.

3. **Capture portrait aesthetic/vibe** - Cyberpunk, kawaii, vintage, bohemian, etc. - match the mood.

4. **Include character subtly** - "tiny [exact hair color] figure with [1-2 key accessories from portrait] visible in background/distance/glimpsed through"

5. **Atmospheric world focus** - Describe the miniature environment, not close-up character details.

6. **Film aesthetics naturally woven:**
   - Dream-logic scale: "where [thing] floats like [comparison]"
   - Liminal space: "between [X] and [Y]"
   - Shadow puppet theater depth with layered silhouettes
