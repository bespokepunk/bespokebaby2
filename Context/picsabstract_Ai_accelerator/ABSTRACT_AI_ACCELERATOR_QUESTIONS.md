### Project Details

10. **Project Description***
    > Bespoke Punks is an AI-powered digital identity platform that transforms users into handcrafted 24x24 pixel art portraits. We've built a collection of 174 "Honoraries" - handcrafted pixel art characters - and trained a custom Stable Diffusion LoRA model on this dataset to generate personalized punks that users can mint as on-chain NFTs. Each punk captures your "digital essence" as a unique piece of pixel art that serves as your Web3 identity.

11. **Project Designs***
    > UI/UX designs available at:
    > - Live website: https://bespoke-punks.onrender.com
    > - Homepage with asymmetric layout and dynamic color-shifting effects
    > - Gallery page with 174 curated punk collection
    > - Generate page (Phase 2 coming soon interface)
    > - PunkWorld interactive diorama system for each character

12. **Business Model***
    > **Multiple revenue streams:**
    >
    > 1. **Generation Service** - Users pay to generate their custom punk from a photo upload (Phase 2)
    > 2. **On-Chain Minting Fees** - Revenue from NFT minting on Abstract (Phase 3)
    > 3. **Trait Customization** - Premium features for trait engine and customization options
    > 4. **Physical Products** - Glass art sculptures and merchandise (leveraging founder's industrial art background)
    > 5. **Live Events** - Art exhibitions and community gatherings
    >
    > Initial focus is on generation + minting fees as primary revenue, with physical products as expansion.

13. **On-chain design***
    > **On-chain transaction generation:**
    >
    > 1. **NFT Minting** - Each generated punk is minted as an ERC-721 NFT on Abstract
    > 2. **Trait Engine** - On-chain trait registry storing punk attributes (hair color, accessories, skin tone, expression)
    > 3. **Identity Registration** - Users register their punk as their on-chain digital identity
    > 4. **Collection Trading** - Secondary market transactions for punk collectibles
    > 5. **Gaming Integration** - "Play as your punk" feature will generate gaming transactions (Phase 4)
    >
    > Each user interaction (generate → customize → mint → trade → play) creates on-chain activity. With thousands of potential custom punks, this creates sustained transaction volume.
